# Using-RNNs-to-classify-sentiments-on-IMDB-data

In this project I tried to learn sentiment analysis so we will train a "vanilla" RNN to predict the sentiment on IMDB reviews. 
Our data consists of 25000 training sequences and 25000 test sequences. 

The outcome is binary (positive/negative) and both outcomes are equally represented in both the training and the test set.
